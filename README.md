# 3Jocks 
Revolutionizing NFT ownership by harnessing the power of Safe's Account Abstraction making NFT ownership accessible to everyone.

3Jocks is game-changing solution addressing the challenges of NFT ownership exclusivity. We firmly believe that NFTs should be accessible to a broader community, not just a select few. Our platform introduces a novel and innovative approach, enabling groups of users to pool their resources and collectively acquire NFTs that may otherwise be financially out of reach for individual enthusiasts by harnessing the power of Safe's Account Abstraction.

## Technologies Used
#### Safe:
The core of 3Jocks' technology is the deployment of Safe Multisig accounts with account abstraction. These accounts are established when a group of users reaches the specified threshold for an NFT purchase. Safe Multisig with account abstraction is typically implemented on Ethereum, providing a secure and decentralized way to manage the ownership and control of NFTs collectively.

#### Tableland - Web3 Backend
To store and manage the data of NFTs and users on the platform, 3Jocks utilizes Tableland, a web3 backend. Tableland ensures data transparency, integrity, and accessibility, making it possible for users to track their NFT purchases and group activities in real-time.

#### Sismo Connect: 
Ensuring user authentication and identity verification is critical for building trust in the NFT space. 3Jocks incorporates Sismo Connect to authenticate users securely when they list an existing NFT in the marketplace. This helps in verifying the identities of users while maintaining their privacy and security.

#### APE Coin: 
APE Coin is at the core of the platform's NFT transactions. It serves as the currency for purchasing NFTs and is the token used within 3Jocks for group members to contribute their share toward NFT acquisitions. APE Coin integration ensures a smooth and efficient transaction process. Furthermore, we added apecoinDAO membership check in sismo connect.

#### Axelar: 
The Axelar protocol is employed to enable cross-chain transactions. This technology allows users to participate in 3Jocks activities, regardless of their preferred blockchain. By facilitating seamless interoperability, Axelar contributes to the platform's accessibility and inclusivity. NFTs can be bought at any of the chain with the help of Axelar cross chain communication regardelss of where safe wallet is deployed.

##### Feedback:

We have previously utilized Connext and Hyperlane, and this was first time, I have used Axelar. I must say, my experience with Axelar was quite positive. The documentation provided by Axelar is excellent and made the implementation process straightforward. I found it easy to understand and implement the necessary steps. Overall, my first encounter with Axelar has been impressive.
